## Sales Data Analysis

### Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of sales data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that can help drive business decisions. By leveraging Python and various data analysis libraries, we perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to transform raw sales data into actionable insights.

### Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis to understand data distribution, outliers, and key statistics.
- **Visualization**: Clear and informative plots to illustrate sales trends, seasonal effects, and performance metrics.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, we provide actionable insights and strategic recommendations to enhance sales performance.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Core programming language used for analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data analysis and visualization environment.

### Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Importing sales data from CSV files.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data formats.
3. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the central tendencies, dispersion, and shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Relationship between Quantity ordered per year
   - Sales trends over time.
   - Total Sales per year
   - Distribution of Sales
   - Relationship between Discount and Profit
   - Sales By Market
   - Profit Based on Category
